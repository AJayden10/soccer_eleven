The program collects input as stats from a coaches training session and the program determines the best xi based on those stats.
The set of stats is varied based on the position the player plays in.
The coach will be asked to input the players name and position then the stat ratings out of a hundred
The program then averages the players scores and then picks the best eleven players to start the match during the weekend
